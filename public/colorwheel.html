        <h3>Color Wheel</h3>
        <div class="color-wheel-main">
          <div>
            <p>
              The color wheel is a visual representation of colors arranged
              according to their chromatic relationship, forming a circular
              diagram. It organizes colors in a circular format to illustrate
              the relationships between primary, secondary, and tertiary colors,
              making it easier to understand how colors interact with one
              another.
            </p>
            <p>
              Primary colors—red, blue, and yellow—are positioned equidistantly
              on the wheel and serve as the foundation for all other colors. By
              mixing primary colors, we obtain secondary colors, such as green,
              orange, and purple. Tertiary colors are created by blending a
              primary color with a neighboring secondary color, resulting in
              hues like red-orange and blue-green.
            </p>
            <p>
              The color wheel is a fundamental tool in design and art, helping
              artists and designers create harmonious and visually appealing
              color schemes. By understanding the relationships between colors,
              one can apply various color schemes—such as complementary,
              analogous, or triadic—to evoke specific emotions, highlight
              contrasts, or establish visual balance within a composition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, the color wheel guides the use of warm and cool
              colors, aiding in the creation of depth, emphasis, and focus
              within a piece of art or design. For example, warm colors like red
              and orange tend to advance in a composition, drawing attention,
              while cool colors like blue and green recede, creating a calming
              background.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, the color wheel is an indispensable reference for anyone
              involved in visual arts, interior design, fashion, and even
              marketing, as it provides a clear and intuitive way to choose and
              combine colors effectively.

        <div class="color-sections">
          <div class="color-scheme" id="Analogous">
            <h4>Analogous</h4>
            <p>
              Analogous colors are groups of three colors that are next to each
              other on the color wheel. They typically match well and create
              serene and comfortable designs. When used together, they evoke
              harmony and cohesiveness, often seen in nature, which makes them
              pleasing to the eye.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="color-scheme" id="Monochromatic">
            <h4>Monochromatic</h4>
            <p>
              Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a single base hue and
              extended using its shades, tones, and tints. This approach is
              simple yet elegant, creating a visually appealing and cohesive
              design. Monochromatic schemes are often used to create a sense of
              calm and uniformity.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="color-scheme" id="Triad">
            <h4>Triad</h4>
            <p>
              A triadic color scheme uses three colors that are evenly spaced
              around the color wheel, forming a triangle. This type of color
              scheme is vibrant and balanced, offering a strong visual contrast
              while retaining harmony. It's a popular choice for projects that
              need a dynamic and energetic appearance.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="color-scheme" id="Complementary">
            <h4>Complementary</h4>
            <p>
              Complementary colors are pairs of colors that are opposite each
              other on the color wheel. When placed next to each other, they
              create the strongest contrast and reinforce each other's
              intensity. This scheme is often used to make elements stand out,
              creating a vibrant and eye-catching effect.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="color-scheme" id="SplitComplementary">
            <h4>Split Complementary</h4>
            <p>
              The split complementary color scheme is a variation of the
              complementary scheme. It involves a base color and the two colors
              adjacent to its complementary color. This creates a more balanced
              and less intense contrast while retaining the vibrancy and
              attention-grabbing qualities of complementary colors.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="color-scheme" id="Square">
            <h4>Square</h4>
            <p>
              A square color scheme consists of four colors evenly spaced around
              the color wheel, forming a square. This approach offers variety
              and vibrancy, with a harmonious yet dynamic feel. Square color
              schemes are ideal for creating visually rich and engaging designs
              that maintain balance.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="color-scheme" id="Compound">
            <h4>Compound</h4>
            <p>
              The compound, or double-complementary, color scheme uses four
              colors, consisting of two complementary pairs. This scheme offers
              more variety than the traditional complementary scheme, with the
              added benefit of more balanced and nuanced contrasts. It’s a
              versatile option for complex designs.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="color-scheme" id="Shades">
            <h4>Shades</h4>
            <p>
              Shades are created by adding black to a base hue, darkening the
              color. Using shades in design adds depth, dimension, and a sense
              of sophistication. This approach is often used to create more
              dramatic and moody aesthetics while maintaining a cohesive color
              palette.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="color-scheme" id="Custom">
            <h4>Custom</h4>
            <p>
              A custom color scheme is tailored to the specific needs and
              preferences of a project, allowing for a unique and personalized
              approach. By carefully selecting and combining colors, a custom
              scheme can convey specific emotions, themes, or branding elements,
              making it a powerful tool in design.
